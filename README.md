SLY is a Common Lisp IDE for Emacs.

See it in action [this screencast][7]. SLY is currently **alpha** status but
read the [NEWS.md][6] file for the latest news.

SLY is a fork of [SLIME][1], which is the work of Eric Marsden, Luke Gorrie,
Helmut Eller Tobias, C. Rittweiler and [many-others][8].

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

Add this to your `~/.emacs` file and fill in the appropriate filenames:

```el
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/dir/to/cloned/sly")
(require 'sly-autoloads)
(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl")
```

Use `M-x sly` to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.  SLY will now
automatically be available in your Lisp source buffers.

This also works
```
$ sbcl
...
* (push #p"~/dir/to/cloned/sly" asdf:*central-registry*)
* (asdf:load-system :slynk)
* (slynk:create-server :port 4008)
```

Now in Emacs you can do `sly-connect` and give it the host and the 4008 port as
a destination.
