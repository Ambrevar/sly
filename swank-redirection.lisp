;;;; Globally redirect IO to the main mrepl
;;;
;;; This code handles redirection of the standard I/O streams
;;; (`*standard-output*', etc) into Emacs. The `connection' structure
;;; contains the appropriate streams, so all we have to do is make the
;;; right bindings.

;;;;; Global I/O redirection framework
;;;
;;; Optionally, the top-level global bindings of the standard streams
;;; can be assigned to be redirected to Emacs. When Emacs connects we
;;; redirect the streams into the connection, and they keep going into
;;; that connection even if more are established. If the connection
;;; handling the streams closes then another is chosen, or if there
;;; are no connections then we revert to the original (real) streams.
;;;
;;; It is slightly tricky to assign the global values of standard
;;; streams because they are often shadowed by dynamic bindings. We
;;; solve this problem by introducing an extra indirection via synonym
;;; streams, so that *STANDARD-INPUT* is a synonym stream to
;;; *CURRENT-STANDARD-INPUT*, etc. We never shadow the "current"
;;; variables, so they can always be assigned to affect a global
;;; change.

*STANDARD-INPUT*.

3. Assigns *STANDARD-INPUT* to a synonym stream pointing to
